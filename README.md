Android Application

This is for IT4785 (Capella University) android Programming Week 3. I have sturggled with this class since it has started! The goal of this assignment is to use best buy's api store area function and display in a list view. So the task is to have the user enter in  miles and radius and then connect to BestBuy API get store information that is close to user's input and display in a list view for the user to see.
