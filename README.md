Android Application

This is for IT4785 (Capella University) android Programming Week 3. I have sturggled with this class since it has started! The goal of this assignment is to use best buy's api store area function and display in a list view. So the task is to have the user enter in a miles and radius and then connect to BestBuy API get store information that is close to user's input and display in a list view for the user to see. I am currently stuck on this assignment and need help! I have gotten to the point in my code that I can recieve the Json although getting it in a list view and getting it on the screen has proved to be to difficult for me. Any help is greatly appreciated! I also need to figure out how to get the user input into the URL to search to search for what ever the user puts in as there zip code.
